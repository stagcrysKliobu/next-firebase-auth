## The Anime Series
 
The anime series of Initial D is divided into five stages: First Stage (1998), Second Stage (1999), Third Stage (2001), Fourth Stage (2004-2006), and Fifth Stage (2012-2013). Each stage covers a different arc of the manga, which was written by Shuichi Shigeno and ran from 1995 to 2013. The anime follows the main plot of the manga closely, with some minor changes and additions.
 
The story revolves around Takumi Fujiwara, a high school student who works part-time at his father's tofu shop. Every night, he delivers tofu to a hotel on Mount Akina, using his father's old Toyota AE86 Sprinter Trueno. Unbeknownst to him, his father is a former racing legend who has trained him to be an expert driver through his daily deliveries. Takumi soon attracts the attention of the local street racing teams, who challenge him to downhill races on Mount Akina and other mountain passes. Along the way, he meets various rivals, friends, and love interests, and learns more about his father's past and his own potential.
 
The anime series is known for its realistic depiction of cars and driving techniques, as well as its use of computer-generated imagery (CGI) to enhance the animation. The series also features a distinctive soundtrack composed mainly of Eurobeat songs, which add to the excitement and mood of the races. Some of the most famous songs include "Running in the 90s" by Max Coveri, "Deja Vu" by Dave Rodgers, and "Night of Fire" by Niko.
 
## The Live-Action Movie
 
In 2005, a live-action movie adaptation of Initial D was released in Hong Kong and Japan. The movie was directed by Andrew Lau and Alan Mak, who are best known for their Infernal Affairs trilogy. The movie stars Jay Chou as Takumi Fujiwara, Edison Chen as Ryosuke Takahashi, Shawn Yue as Keisuke Takahashi, Anthony Wong as Bunta Fujiwara, and Anne Suzuki as Natsuki Mogi.
 
The movie condenses the first two stages of the anime into a single storyline, focusing on Takumi's battles against the Red Suns team led by the Takahashi brothers. The movie also introduces some original characters and subplots, such as Takumi's rivalry with an old friend named Itsuki (played by Chapman To), and Natsuki's involvement with a middle-aged man (played by Kenny Bee). The movie also changes some details of the cars and races to suit the live-action format.
 
The movie received mixed reviews from critics and fans alike. Some praised the movie for its faithful adaptation of the source material, its impressive car stunts, and its star-studded cast. Others criticized the movie for its poor acting, cheesy dialogue, and lack of character development. The movie was also controversial for its use of Mandarin instead of Japanese or Cantonese as the main language.
